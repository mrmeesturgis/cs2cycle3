    "## Narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "Onward and upward. So we've started manipulating lists. We know how to debug a bit, and we can build some simple functions. We're going to stay at this level for the most part this week, but start to enrich some of these ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutable and immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's talk about mutable and immutable. Mutable means 'able to be changed', and immutable means 'unable to be changed'. Look at the following description of data types. I find it especially interesting that intigers are immutable. How can this be?! We'll talk more about that later, but for now what's interesting is that there actually only three mutable types of data. For the others we can still change them, but we have to do it in a roundabout way. We have to reassign them. We're going to practice this using the tuple data type. e.g. `tuplevariable = ('example1', example2)` Note that a tuple can hold multiple data types at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mutable vs Immutable](mutable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List of lists\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've looked at a single list. Something that looks like this. `list1 = ['str1', 'str2', 'str3']` But lists have even more functionality. You can actually have a list of lists. This can be very useful. Let's imagine that we have a list of strings, but what we really want is a list of tokens. Take a look at the following image. \n",
    "\n",
    "![List vs. List of list](listoflists.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note a few things. First note that one list has only one bracket. And the other has two brackets. Then note that in both there are commas, in the first the commas separate the strings, in the second they separate the brackets, which indicates to us that they are separating lists. I could then iterate over multiple layers of data. Think of it like this `listoflists <-> lists <-> strings <-> characters`. As is very common we start with very simple elements and start building more and more complex elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are a data type which we have briefly encountered before. They are generally marked off by parenthesis e.g. `(element1, element2, element3)` Tuples are immutable, which means that you can't modify their structure once you built them. But you can always just make a new tuple if you need to 'modify' it. Just like lists, tuples can hold a variety of elements within, even at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "So Boolean is a data type as well. While it is not all that common overtly, sometimes the presence of something is equivalent to `True` and the absence of something is equivalant to `False`. Consider the string method `islower()`, which returns either `True` or `False`. As far as a datatype there's not much else to say about it. It literally has only two possible elements. Note, however, that it is keyworded with an initial capital letter: false != `False` and true != `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More complex functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Last cycle we looked at the function that compared the word length of strings. This week we are going to build up a few more complex functions. Complex by definition does not mean 'trickier', but rather 'having more parts'. It just so happens that things that have more parts generally are trickier."

    "### Question 1: Boolean Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with boolean expressions. In order to pass the assert check you need to be able to transform a list into a boolean value, based on whether or not it is true. To practice this I'm going to give you a tuple of two numbers. You will do some math and return either `True` if it has a remainder or returns a number with decimal points, or `False` if it doesn't. Take note! the modulus operator `%` might be very helpful. It checks to see if there is a remainder after a division. Alternatively you can check the type. If it has a decimal point it's going to be `float`, rather than `int`."
